Dear Administrator,

I am writing to formally request an immediate and documented due-diligence review regarding the appointment and continued affiliation of Mr. Eissa Hashemi as an Adjunct Faculty member at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (TCSPP).

Mr. Hashemi is publicly identified as the son of Masoumeh Ebtekar, a senior figure of the Islamic Republic in Iran and a principal spokesperson during the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis—an event involving the unlawful detention of 52 American diplomats for 444 days. This is not a marginal historical footnote; it is a defining act of Islamic regime-sponsored extremism with ongoing political, legal, and moral ramifications in the United States.

Given this background, TCSPP’s association with an immediate family member of such a figure raises serious and unavoidable concerns related to:
	•	institutional due diligence and reputational risk,
	•	compliance with U.S. sanctions, ethics, and foreign influence safeguards,
	•	and consistency in standards applied to Iranian nationals in academic contexts, particularly when UNAFFILIATED students and scholars face heightened scrutiny or exclusion.

It would be negligent for an academic institution operating in the United States to dismiss the relevance of such close familial ties without demonstrable, documented review. Universities are not insulated from scrutiny when appointments intersect with politically sensitive or sanctioned regimes—especially when public trust and donor confidence are at stake.

Accordingly, I request confirmation of the following:
	1.	That a comprehensive background and conflict-of-interest review was conducted prior to Mr. Hashemi’s appointment.
	2.	That his familial ties were disclosed and evaluated as part of that process.
	3.	That the institution has assessed potential reputational, ethical, and compliance risks associated with this appointment.

If such reviews were not conducted, that omission itself warrants immediate corrective action.

I expect this matter to be treated with the seriousness it deserves. Silence or dismissal would reasonably be interpreted as institutional indifference to legitimate concerns of accountability, transparency, and public trust.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

```
